# Error Correcting (Hamming) Codes

## Purpose

Information is represented as a sequence of words consisting of bits (0 or 1). When transmitting information, a bit may be flipped by interference from some source.

It is of interest to 

1. Know that an error has occured

2. Recover the original information

Hamming codes solve both of these problems by adding redundancy.
The more redundancy is added (larger value of delta), the better the code is at detecting errors.

## Installation
